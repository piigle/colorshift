You are a mystical triangle being that moves through the colors of light as through dimensions. You can control what you see and interact with at a time. What you cannot see cannot hurt you.

Use the Arrow Keys or WASD to move through the world.
Use keys 1-5, shift + mouse, or rightclick+mouse to change colors.
Click or press E to pick up/put down items around you.
Press R to respawn.
Press T to reset the entire level.

Use your inherent intelligence, creativity, and skill to succeed in each level. If you can.
